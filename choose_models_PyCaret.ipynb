We will now give a brief explanation for our decision to prioritize these measures.\n",

        "Notice that the dataset is very imbalanced. Only 0.17% of transactions are fraudulent ('Class' = 1), so a model that predicts every transaction is valid would immediately have an accuracy of 99.83% . Therefore, we care more about precision and recall than we do accuracy. A model with a large AUC ROC will score well in precision and recall for our choice of threshold hyperparameter.\n",

        "In other words, if recall is low, then there are fraudulent transactions that our model is just not able to detect.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the **precision/recall tradeoff**. By lowering the threshold hyperparameter, we will have lower precision but higher recall. The model will be more sensitive to outliers. It will detect more cases of fraud, but result in more upset customers. On the other hand, increasing the threshold hyperparameter will make the model less sensitive. It will ignore the transactions that are somewhat suspicious, resulting in fewer upset customers, but missing some of the borderline fraud cases. A model with high AUC ROC and F1 score will capture the optimal solution to this tradeoff problem, resulting in models that have both a high precision and a high recall.
